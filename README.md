A sleek toggle for a webpage. Done **iOS** style, and highly reusable. Careful detail was went into crafting this component, including ensuring the cursor is a pointer when interacting with the toggle, and text selection is **not** triggered when interacting with the toggle. The toggle was designed to be highly reusable and customizable, and just all around over-engineered to be honest. ü§£

Here is a list of props that can be passed on the toggled to easily customize the toggle appearance:

```

const toggledSettings = {
    toggled: false, // The boolean value the toggle relies on.
    container: {
      outerHeight: 30, // Specifies the height dimensions of the outer container. This value measurement is pixels.
      outerWidth: 60 // Specifies the width dimensions of the outer container. This value measurement is pixels.
      toggledColor: 'blue', // Specifies the outer container background color when the toggle is toggled.
      defaultColor: 'red', // Specifies the outer container background color when the toggle is not toggled. 

    },
    inner: {
      toggledColor: 'blue', // Specifies the inner circle background color when the toggle is toggled.
      defaultColor: 'red', // Specifies the inner circle background color when the toggle is not toggled.
    }
  };

```

**Note the following:** 

1. The value measurement for all width and height keys is **pixels**. 
2. All color props support RGBA, RGB, HEX and colors names. If none of these props are passed, defaults are assumed. The defaults measurements are as follows:

```

const toggledSettings = {
    toggled: false, 
    container: {
      outerHeight: 30, 
      outerWidth: 60 
      toggledColor: ‚Äò#30D158 ,
      defaultColor: '#39393D',  

    },
    inner: {
      toggledColor: ‚Äòwhite‚Äô,
      defaultColor: ‚Äòwhite‚Äô, 
    }
  };

```
